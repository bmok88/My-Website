      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p> Hey, welcome to my website! This site is the first solo project I've done, and I've gotta say, it was incredibly fun to build. Hope you enjoy. <br />
          A pre-med student turned software engineer, I have a special desire in creating software that can attract millions of users and greatly benefit society. My primary focus is the front end because I naturally like to make things look aesthetically pleasing, but I have full stack experience and eventually want to focus more on the back end. In an alternate universe, I would be in med school right now, but alas, here I am.<br />
