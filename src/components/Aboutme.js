      <p>   A former pre-med student turned software engineer, I love all things JavaScript, basketball, outdoors, and food. I discovered my passion for programming after taking it up as a side hobby and realizing that I could create whatever I wanted with limitless possibilities. I also thoroughly enjoy how programming challenges you to look at a problem from different angles and to think through algorithms in different ways.</p>

        Currently, my primary focus is the front end because I derive satisfaction from creating unique user interfaces and aesthetically pleasing web apps to deliver the best user experience. However, I'm keen on the full stack as well and take pleasure in back end development. If you or a friend knows of an opportunity that you think I might be interested in, please don't hesistate to reach out. I'm always open to chatting about anything!</p>
