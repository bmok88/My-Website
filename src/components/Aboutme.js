      <p>Hey, my name is Brendan Mok, and I love all things JavaScript. A pre-med student turned software engineer, I have a special desire in creating software that can attract millions of users and greatly benefit society. My primary focus is the front end because I naturally like to make things look aesthetically pleasing, but I have full stack experience and eventually want to focus more on the back end. I am fluent in JavaScript, but I eventually want to branch out to other languages such as Python and Go.</p>
